/* Operator in java
    1) it is used to perform operation using operand.
    2) operand can be variable and constant.
    3) operator has defined as a function using symbol and alphabates.
    4) operator are predefined functions in java .
 imp-->5) operaror overloadinf not allowed in java . deos not follow operator overloading concept java.
           operator overloading allowed in c++,
            in c++ we can use operator name as function that is --> operator overloading
     operator + (object 0)
        {

        }
         a*b --> a.*(b)

     6) types of operator in java
        1) unary operator
            it is work using single operand.
            1)increment unary operator
               1)Post increment   a++
               2)Pre  increment  ++a
            2)decrement unary operator
                1)post decrement  --a
                2) pre decrement  a--

              post increment or decrement
                   first complete other operation then increase or decrease value.

              pre increment or decrement
                    first increase or decrease value then perform other operation.

             3) minus opetator
                it is used to change positive value to negative value.
                a=2;
                -a;

        2) binary operator
            minimun two operand is required for binary operatior
            1) Arithmetic operator
                +,-,*,/,%
            2) Conditional operators
                <,>,<=,>=,==
            3) Logical operator
                &&,||,!
                logical && --> when all condition will true then &&  return true value.
                logical || --> when particular condition will true then will return true value.
                logical !  --> it opposite of true statement. true =false, false=true
            4) Assignment Operator
                simple =
                complex +=,-=,*=,/=,%=
                a+=5-->a=a+5; a-=3--> a=a-3; a*=2--> a=a*2 ; a/=2--> a=a/2;
            5) Comparison operator
                ==      -> value type comparision
                equls() -> reference type comparision

         3) Ternary operator
            it is used to solve condition based on problem.
            we provide condition,and it will return true or false value.
            var=(condition)?true:false;
