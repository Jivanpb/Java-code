    Component of class
        it is used to describe compenent of class which is used to define the functionality of object.
        1) data member
            it is used to define attribute of object.
            in java data member has divided memory allocation.
            type of data member
                1) static data member
                it will be acess by class name and allocate memory at compile time .
                declaration --->  static datatype indentifier = value;
                                 static int x =10;
                static has constant memory means it's memory will be created only time in whole program.
                important question of static data member
                 1) we can call static variable by object or not?
                 --> yes we can call by object but static memory will be created at compile time hence static value
                     will be stored in compile time memory area not in runtime memory area.
                      hence runtime memory no use then it will refer to garbase collector.
                2)dynamic data member
                  this type of data member will allocate memory at runtime using object.
                  it is also called instance variable in java.
                  it will access by object.
                  declaration ---> datatype identifier = value;
                                  int x = 5;

        2) member function or function
        3) static block
        4) initializer block
        5) constructor
        6) property
        7) innner class
